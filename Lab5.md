# Lab Report 3
By: Sara Standlee
## Part 1 - Debugging Scenario
* The original post from a student with a screenshot showing a symptom and a description of a guess at the bug/some sense of what the failure-inducing input is.



* A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try



* Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.


* All the information needed about the setup:
  * The file & directory structure needed
 

  * The contents of each file before fixing the bug
 

  * The full command line (or lines) you ran to trigger the bug
 

  *  description of what to edit to fix the bug






## Part 2 - Reflection
In the second half of the quarter, I personally found vim to be cool to learn about. Before this lab, I was not familiar with navigating a system through the command line. Thus, I've found the tools, specifically how to navigate through files and directories at the command line, to be useful. However, I had wondered how we could change a file from the command line. Learning about vim had answered my question. I also found the shortcuts we learned through vimtutor to be interested to learn and memorize.
